    <h4> What is Media Literacy? </h4>
      <p> Media literacy is a commonly used term in the context of education. But what does it actually mean? "According to the National Association for Media Literacy Education, media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, create, and act using all forms of communication. Media literacy means anything from interpreting emojis to understanding underlying messages in online advertisements to producing viral video content and recognizing native advertising"(thetechadvocate.org).</p>
    <h4> Why Does it Matter? </h4>
    <p>Communication is basis of society. However, with the emergence of technology such as the internet, and social media, the average American is bombarded with extreme amounts of information everyday. Determining the intended purpose or message of these communications is crucial to a functioning and democratic society. The importance of this concept is most drastically illustrated when examining the past few American Presidential elections. With a cloud of controversy and accusations of misinformation influencing these elections, the question seems simple: What is the correct way to evaluate whether a source of information is trustworthy? And more importantly, can the general American population distinguish the difference between so-called "fake" and "real" news? This is where media literacy come into play. Yet, media literacy has implications far past just American elections, it is an important skill that allows all people to become conscientious consumers of any media. </p>

   <h4> How to Improve </h4>
      <p> 
      The first rule of how to improve media literacy is to be aware. It is easy to make a site/ a piece of media look reputable, so it is a good idea to cross reference and double check any information you are absorbing. Additionally check your source. Where is the information coming from? What motives could the source have for distributing the information they are. Lastly, use fact checkers. Sites like MBFC News, FactCheck.org, and FullFact.org are trustworthy sites for checking information. These tips may all seem like common sense, however, they are important to keep in mind as we all continue to navigate an increasingly cluttered digital media landscape.
