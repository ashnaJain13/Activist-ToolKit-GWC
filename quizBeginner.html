      <h2 class=headlines>Astronaut Clearly Only Selected For Mission Because He’s Related To Moon</h2>
      <p> WASHINGTON—Implying that he likely wouldn’t have earned the spot without a healthy dose of nepotism, NASA crew members told reporters Wednesday that astronaut Joseph Mesic was clearly only selected for their mission because he was related to the moon. “Right from the beginning, it’s been extremely clear that Joseph was not as qualified as the rest of the crew, and only got the connection through his extremely powerful and influential father, who is an 81-quintillion-ton natural satellite that orbits earth,” said NASA Captain Trevor Anderson, adding that every other crew member had either been a doctor, a fighter pilot, or an air force commander, but Mesic’s only qualification was that he had a family connection to the moon. “Don’t get me wrong, he’s definitely talented, but it’s pretty unfair that he just gets to cut the line because his daddy is a big rock that lives in space. I spent decades training for this, but suddenly the moon’s son just waltzes in and gets to go to space? Too bad my dad wasn’t a high-ranking member of the solar system.”- The Onion </p>

        <h2 class=headlines>Rare tiny creatures uncovered in Highland caves</h2>
      <p> "Rare microscopic crustaceans have been discovered in two caves in the Highlands. Researchers believe the species of ostracod uncovered in Smoo Cave in Sutherland and Allt nan Uamh Stream Cave in Assynt could be a first for Scotland.They are about one millimetre in size and live in pools inside the caves. Scientists Lee Knight and Dominika Wroblewska made the finds while sampling 32 caves across Scotland.Dr Knight said: “Styglobitic creatures live entirely below the earth’s surface and preliminary findings show that one particular ostracod could be the first recorded in Scotland. “The specimens have been tentatively identified as Fabaeformiscandona latens from Allt nan Uamh Stream Cave and Smoo Cave, these are of importance because records of this genus are very rare in Britain.'"- BBC News</p>
